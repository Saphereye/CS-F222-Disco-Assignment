# CS222 Discrete Structures For Computer Science assignment
This project deals with writing a well-documented C program which takes a file as input and,
- Part A: Calculates the [degree sequence](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DegreeSequence.html)
- Part B: Calculates whether two graphs are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism)

## How to run the program
Requirements
------------
1. `bash`
2. `gcc` and `c99`
3. `make`

Steps
-----
1. Put desired input in input.txt
2. Run `make` in command line
3. The output would be seen in stdout(command line)
